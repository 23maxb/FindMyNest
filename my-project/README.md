## Overview

**Find My Nest** is a personality-based housing and roommate matching web application. By selecting your MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality type, you can discover suitable housing options and compatible roommates. The application also suggests color palettes and interior decoration ideas that align with your personality type.

- **Housing Matches**: The app provides housing options that are a good fit for the selected personality type.
- **Roommate Matching**: Compatible roommates are suggested based on MBTI compatibility.
- **Interior Decoration Suggestions**: The app also provides interior decoration recommendations tailored to the user's personality type.

## Technologies Used
